# weebRadar

A one day react web app project to explore using API's.
I had a pretty specific style in mind when I started the project asnd was really happy with how the styling turned out.
If I'd had more time I would have expanded upon the functionality, including building a proper backend for the app to store user favorites etc.

To run the project all that is required is node then to run the following terminal commands.
```
  npm install
  
  npm run dev
```
